# jsTasks web app
TECHCareers Assignment 3 - Simple JavaScript TODO app (with a twist)

This is my first JavaScript app - a simple take on the classic to-do concept. As it is based on pure JS, data is not persistent.

## Assignment
* Create a simple to-do app that can handle adding, editing and deleting tasks through a simple, intuitive interface.

* The app should be able to visually sort items based on their completion status (i.e. in pending, active, completed columns)

* Creation, completion, editing, etc. times should be shown together with the tasks.

* Allow the user to estimate completion time for each task, then compare and report status of the task back to the user (late, early, etc.)
